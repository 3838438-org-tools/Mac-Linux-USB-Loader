These images are compiled from the normal, GRUB 2 source tree. They are essentially compiled versions of GRUB with an embedded configuration file (grub.cfg). Under the stipulations of the GNU General Public License, version 3, the license under which GRUB 2 is governed, you are required to distribute the source code for any modifications that you make. These images, however, were not created by me, rather, they were obtained from the following web site:

The images, as far as I can tell, do not use a modified copy of the GRUB 2 codebase and only contain an embedded configuration file that sets up the loopback and boots the kernel. However, the author never released the source code, in violation of the GPL. Attempts to contact the author for the code have failed. Because of this, I cannot distribute the source code. Because of this license violation, I am transitioning to my own EFI loader to replace these images. You can find all necessary information on my blog at http://sevenbits-tech-blog.blogspot.com and on the webpage for my EFI bootloader Enterprise at http://sevenbits.github.io/Enterprise/ .
