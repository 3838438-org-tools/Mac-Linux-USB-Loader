<p>This is a tool allowing you to put a Linux distro on a USB drive and make it bootable on Intel Macs using EFI. Right now, it's very basic and rudimentary but is being very actively developed. Some advanced features are being developed for Mac Linux USB Loader that are not available in other live USB creators for Mac, such as the ability to make the Live USB drives created by this tool automatically boot on your Mac, a Compatibility Tester application, and more!</p>

<p>The application is available in English and is partially translated into Spanish. Most user interface elements are translated, but dialog boxes and recent additions (particularly in development branches) remain in English.</p>

<p>I recommend that you download the latest version (link below), but if you want to build from source code, use the following steps (*Note:* more thorough steps on building from source are <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/wiki/Building">here</a>).</p>

<pre><code>mkdir whatever
cd whatever
git clone git://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.git
xcodebuild
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note: if you get an error about the certificate "Mac Developer" not being present, this means 
that you are not enrolled in the Mac Developer Program. Code signing is enabled as a benefit to Mac
developers. If you are not enrolled as a paid member of the <strong>Mac</strong> Developer Program, use
<code>xcodebuild CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO</code> instead of <code>xcodebuild</code> as shown
above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can also go into the Xcode project and build from there, but that makes a debug build that is not useful unless you intend you help develop the application.</p>

<p><a href="http://sevenbits.github.com/downloads/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.zip">Click here</a> to download the latest version of Mac Linux USB Loader (I'll try to keep that up to date ;) ). Seriously old builds (like my initial betas) can be found <a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/downloads">here</a>, though you <strong>really</strong> shouldn't download those unless you have a good reason. Building the program yourself is <em>the best way</em> to see the new features.</p>

<p>Beta releases, FYI, are not guaranteed by me <em>in any way</em>. They may eat your hamster. </p>
