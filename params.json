Right now, it's very basic and rudimentary but is being very actively developed.\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8tNNbrM02PE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nTo build it, perform the following steps from the command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir whatever\r\ncd whatever\r\ngit clone git@github.com:SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.git\r\nxcodebuild\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also go into the Xcode project and build from there, but that makes a debug build that is not useful unless you intend you help develop the application.\r\n\r\n[Click here](http://sevenbits.github.com/downloads/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.zip) for the most semi-stable recent build (I'll try to keep that up to date ;) ). You can also older download pre-build binaries [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/downloads), though using the recent version is recommended in all cases. Building the program yourself is _the best way_ to see the new features.\r\n\r\nAnd when I say this is beta-quality software, I mean it. It may eat your hamster.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
