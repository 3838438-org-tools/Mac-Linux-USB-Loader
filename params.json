Right now, it's very basic and rudimentary but is being very actively developed.\r\n\r\nTo build it, perform the following steps from the command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir whatever\r\ncd whatever\r\ngit clone git@github.com:SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.git\r\nxcodebuild\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also go into the Xcode project and build from there, but that makes a debug build that is not useful unless you intend you help develop the application.\r\n\r\nYou can also download pre-build binaries [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/downloads), though there is a close to 100% chance that it is out of date. [Click here](https://github.com/downloads/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/Mac%20Linux%20USB%20Loader%20R2.zip) for the most recent build (I'll try to keep that up to date ;) ). Building the program yourself is _the best way_ to see the new features.","google":""}
