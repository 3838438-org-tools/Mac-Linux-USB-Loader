{"name":"Mac Linux USB Loader","tagline":"Tool allowing you to put a Linux distribution on a USB drive and make it bootable on Intel Macs using EFI.","body":"## Mac Linux USB Loader\r\n### What is Mac Linux USB Loader?\r\nMac Linux USB Loader is an application that allows you to create bootable USB drives containing a Linux distribution that can boot natively on Apple's Macintosh computers using its EFI system, regardless of whether or not the selected distribution has UEFI support. It is available in English and is translated into Spanish and Traditional Chinese. For information on available translations, please see [here](https://raw.github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/working/TRANSLATIONS). It has a number of features:\r\n\r\n- Non-destructive install (does not format your USB drive as long as it has a FAT32 filesystem).\r\n- Supports mainstream Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin, and more.\r\n- Includes persistence support for Ubuntu-based distributions (for instructions on how to set it up, see [this link](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/wiki/Using-Persistence-with-Mac-Linux-USB-Loader).\r\n- Automatically detects all removable devices.\r\n\r\n**[Click here](http://sevenbits.github.com/downloads/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.zip) to download the latest stable version of Mac Linux USB Loader.** You can see all releases, including betas, along with download links [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/releases) (if, for instance, you want to use an older version), and ancient, seriously old versions (like my initial, pre-1.0 betas) can be found [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/downloads), though you **really** shouldn't download those unless you have a good reason.\r\n\r\nIf you're a developer, hacker, or just computer-savvy, you can build the program from source code too. You can download the source code from the links above. You can also [clone the source from git and build from the command line](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/wiki/Building). Note that if you have to ask, \"what's git?\" then this is *not* the best way to obtain Mac Linux USB Loader.\r\n\r\n***Want to see everything cool that I work on?
