{"name":"Mac Linux USB Loader","tagline":"Tool allowing you to put a Linux distribution on a USB drive and make it bootable on Intel Macs using EFI.","body":"## Mac Linux USB Loader\r\nThis is a tool allowing you to put a Linux distro on a USB drive and make it bootable on Intel Macs using EFI. Right now, it's very basic and rudimentary but is being very actively developed. Some advanced features are being developed for Mac Linux USB Loader that are not available in other live USB creators for Mac, such as the ability to make the Live USB drives created by this tool automatically boot on your Mac, a Compatibility Tester application, and more!\r\n\r\nThe application is available in English and is translated into Spanish and Traditional Chinese. Most user interface elements are translated, but dialog boxes and recent additions (particularly in development branches) remain in English. For information on available translations, please see [this file](https://raw.github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/working/TRANSLATIONS).\r\n\r\nI recommend that you download the latest version (link below), but if you want to build from source code, use the following steps (*Note:* more thorough steps on building from source are [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/wiki/Building)).\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir whatever\r\ncd whatever\r\ngit clone git://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.git\r\nxcodebuild\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Please note: if you get an error about the certificate \"Mac Developer\" not being present, this means \r\n> that you are not enrolled in the Mac Developer Program. Code signing is enabled as a benefit to Mac\r\n> developers. If you are not enrolled as a paid member of the **Mac** Developer Program, use\r\n> `xcodebuild CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=\"\" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO` instead of `xcodebuild` as shown\r\n> above.\r\n\r\nYou can also go into the Xcode project and build from there, but that makes a debug build that is not useful unless you intend you help develop the application.\r\n\r\n[Click here](http://sevenbits.github.com/downloads/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader.zip) to download the latest version of Mac Linux USB Loader (I'll try to keep that up to date ;) ). Seriously old builds (like my initial betas) can be found [here](https://github.com/SevenBits/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/downloads), though you **really** shouldn't download those unless you have a good reason. Building the program yourself is _the best way_ to see the new features.\r\n\r\nBeta releases, FYI, are not guaranteed by me *in any way*. They may eat your hamster.
